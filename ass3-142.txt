In a BCPL program,

   Define a linked list in a nice clean tidy way.

   Create a linked list containing numbers typed by the user, the
   user will enter -1 to signal the end of the input.

   Print the contents of the linked list in order.

   Reverse the linked list.

   Print the contents of the linked list in its new order.

Then

   Think about how you would implement newvec and freevec so
   that they really work, but only for this example program.
