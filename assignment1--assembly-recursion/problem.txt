Assignment 1, due Thursday 30th January

Implement this C program (or at least teaspoon and tryit) in assembly
language, and make it work properly. Implement the functions properly
using stack frames and using frame-pointer-relative addressing for
parameters and local variables. I just ran this on rabbit and copied
and pasted the code directly here, so I know it works.

Then adapt teaspoon to make your first useful library function: one
that prints numbers nicely in decimal.

Note: I only used printf to keep things familiar. The printf in teaspoon
only ever has to print single digit numbers, so printf("%d", R)
is just printing the character ('0' + R). The printf in tryit only
starts a new line, so it also only needs the TYPE instruction.

#include <stdio.h>

void teaspoon(int N)
{ 
  int Q, R;
  Q = N / 10;
  R = N - Q * 10;
  if (Q > 0)
    teaspoon(Q);
  printf("%d", R);
  if (Q > 0)
    teaspoon(Q);
}

void tryit(void)
{
  teaspoon(1234);
  printf("\n");
  teaspoon(7);
  printf("\n");
  teaspoon(72);
  printf("\n");
  teaspoon(321);
  printf("\n");
  teaspoon(2468135); 
  printf("\n");
}

int main()
{ tryit();
  return 0; }
